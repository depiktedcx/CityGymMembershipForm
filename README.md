# CityGymMembershipForm
Assignment 2 of BIT502 Open Polytechnic

Task 1: Create the Gym Membership UI
Your task is to build a C# GUI application for City Gym. This C# Windows application
will have a single screen: The Member Registration form. This is the screen that you
created a prototype for in Assignment 1.
<br>
The membership form will calculate the membership costs and write the new
membership details to a text file, as outlined in the client brief (see Appendix A).
Make sure to include the following, and also refer to the marking schedule:
  * Create the interface by using a variety of GUI controls available in C#, based
  on the prototype you developed in Assignment 1. Make sure you include all
  items in the City Gym’s paper form, including customer details, membership
  details, payment details and extras.
  * Include a ‘calculate’ button, as mentioned in the client brief (see Appendix A),
  and ensure it applies all fees and discounts, based on the user’s selection of
  options.
  * Make sure membership costs are displayed to the user on calculation. This
  includes:
    * membership cost
    * total of all extras selected
    * total discount applied
    * net membership cost
    * regular payment amount.
  * Ensure your application is maintainable by having self-documenting code and
  that all code comments are suitably placed.
  * The submit button should store new member information to a text file. This
  should capture all details from the membership form.
  * Ensure there is suitable error control by informing the user if there are
incomplete fields or incorrect user input.
Note: You are not required to make an exact replica of your prototype. Any deviation
from your prototype will not impact your final grade for this assignment
