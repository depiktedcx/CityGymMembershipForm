# CityGymMembershipForm
Programming portion of assignment 2 and 3 of BIT502 at Open Polytechnic
# Assignment 2 of BIT502 Open Polytechnic

Task 1: Create the Gym Membership UI
Your task is to build a C# GUI application for City Gym. This C# Windows application
will have a single screen: The Member Registration form. This is the screen that you
created a prototype for in Assignment 1.
<br>
The membership form will calculate the membership costs and write the new
membership details to a text file, as outlined in the client brief (see Appendix A).
Make sure to include the following, and also refer to the marking schedule:
  * Create the interface by using a variety of GUI controls available in C#, based
  on the prototype you developed in Assignment 1. Make sure you include all
  items in the City Gym’s paper form, including customer details, membership
  details, payment details and extras.
  * Include a ‘calculate’ button, as mentioned in the client brief (see Appendix A),
  and ensure it applies all fees and discounts, based on the user’s selection of
  options.
  * Make sure membership costs are displayed to the user on calculation. This
  includes:
    * membership cost
    * total of all extras selected
    * total discount applied
    * net membership cost
    * regular payment amount.
  * Ensure your application is maintainable by having self-documenting code and
  that all code comments are suitably placed.
  * The submit button should store new member information to a text file. This
  should capture all details from the membership form.
  * Ensure there is suitable error control by informing the user if there are
incomplete fields or incorrect user input.
<br>
Note: You are not required to make an exact replica of your prototype. Any deviation
from your prototype will not impact your final grade for this assignment

Your next task is to implement the code for part of the application you have
designed from Task 1. It is recommended you save the Visual Studio project you
worked on for your second assignment as a new solution. This way, you can reuse
the membership form you created.
<br>
You will then create the following screens:
<ul>
    <li>The main menu screen: The user should be able to navigate to the individual
screens, to easily return to it, and to be able to exit the application.</li>
    <li>The membership form screen: You will have already completed the
membership form from Assignment 2. However, you will now need to make
sure that when the new member is saved, the information is stored in the
database rather than written to a file.</li>
    <li>Search members screen: To meet the requirements of being able to search
for members (see Appendix A), you will need to add a data grid to this form.</li>
    <li>Fitness class booking screen: You will need to build this form into your
Visual Studio solution. However, the only code you will need to add to this
form is the code to close the form and return the user to the main menu
screen. The form is a prototype only.</li>
</ul>
Then, create the database you designed for Task 1, and configure the data source to
display tables.
<br>
You will also need to populate the database with the sample data (see Appendix B).
Remember, your design should capture all of the client’s requirements that are
outlined in the case study information. For the implementation of this task, you will be
assessed on your ability to meet the client’s requirements, the functionality of overall
application, and the readability of your code.
